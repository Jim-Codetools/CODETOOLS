		<h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
		
		<p class='disHead'>1. Use at Your Own Risk:</p>
		<p>
		The user assumes full responsibility for any risks arising from the use of this calculator. No guarantee is made 
		regarding the accuracy or suitability of this calculator.	
		</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<p class='disHead'>2. Compliance with NZ Building Code:</p>
		<p>
		This calculator is designed to assist the user in verifying compliance with 
		<a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/1992/0150/latest/whole.html#DLM165403" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NZ building code clause H1</a>
		(Specifically Objective H1.1; Functional Requirement H1.2a; and Performance Criteria H1.3.1a-b, H1.3.2e, 
		and H1.3.3a-f). This calculator is based on the methodology set out in H1/AS1 - 5th Edition, Amendment 1.
		</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<p class='disHead'>3. Usage Limitations:</p>
		<p>
		This calculator can be used to assess housing and other buildings with an area of occupied space no greater 
		than 300 m2. It cannot be used for buildings where an appropriate user option is not available. Note that users 
		may select a more conservative option if an exact one is not available.
		</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<p class='disHead'>4. Construction R Values:</p>
		<p>
		Construction R Values are calculated in accordance with NZS 4214:2006. To enhance the user experience, 
		this calculator makes certain assumptions about the composition of building elements and resulting 
		construction R Values. Users are responsible for understanding these assumptions and their significance in 
		assessing the calculator's suitability. The assumptions used are intentionally conservative and are expected to 
		have only a minor impact, indicating a lower heat loss figure than calculated. Refer to the calculator's technical 
		justification for a detailed description of these assumptions.
		</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<p class='disHead'>5. Copyright and Intellectual Property:</p>
